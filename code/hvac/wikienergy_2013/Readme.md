This folder contains the code to convert WikiEnergy data from 2013 into nilmtk format. 

Prerequisites to generate wikienergy-2013.h5:

* Download [wiki-temp.5]() in ~/Downloads
* Run convert.py
* This will create wikienergy-2013.h5 in ~/


Alternatively, wikienergy-2013 can be obtained directly from [here]() and needs to be put in ~/ for experiments.
