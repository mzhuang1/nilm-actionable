Once done, you can download the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n| Sno | Data | Location in local machine| Description |\r\n| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|:----|\r\n| 1 | [Rice hall fridge data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzucT_Ri96VNa0tKM0VSVHZpalE) | ~\\Documents | Contains data for controlled experiments | \r\n| 2 | [Wiki-temp.h5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzucT_Ri96VNZTlnUGJsdXBKOUE) | ~\\Downloads | Contains data newer version of dataport |\r\n| 3 | [wikienergy-2.h5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzucT_Ri96VNOTdvZ0IxU0ljaUU) | ~\\ | Contains data for old version of data port|\r\n| 4 | [wikinergy-2013.h5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzucT_Ri96VNa3d1XzVRZ2NsUzA) | ~\\ | Contains data for 2013, needed since our HVAC survey is from the same time|\r\n\r\n#### Code for generating figures\r\n\r\nPlease download all the data dependencies before running the following code.\r\n\r\n* Figure 1: code/fridge/fridge_demo.py \r\n\r\n* Figure 2: code/fridge/rice_hall_precision_recall_energy.py\r\nAll the required code is already contained in the Github repo\r\n\r\n* Figure 3: code/hvac/model_setpoint_accuracy.py. This requires data/hvac/top_k_2013.json which is generated using code/hvac/find_top_k_hvac.py. The data/hvac/minutes_GT.csv is created by calling code/hvac/create_hvac_feature_csvs.py\r\n\r\n* Figure 4: code/fridge/fridge_usage_energy_usage_ratio_outlier.py\r\nIt is dependent on `usage_defrost_cycles.csv` which is already there in the Github repository. This CSV can be generated by calling\r\ncode/fridge/fridge_compressor_durations_optimised_jul_7.py. It must be noted that `d_new.to_csv(\"../../data/fridge/usage_defrost_cycles.csv\", index_label=\"home\")` should be uncommented! The function is generic.\r\n\r\n* Figure 5: code/fridge/fridge_defrost_num_cycles_ratio_outlier.py\r\nIt is dependent on `usage_defrost_cycles.csv` which is already there in the Github repository. Remaining instructions same as that for Figure 4.\r\n\r\n* Figure 6: code/fridge/fridge_malfunction.py\r\nRemaining things were edited in Preview.\r\n\r\n* Figure 7: code/hvac/model_accuracy_nilm_gt_confusion_only_gt.py\r\nIt is dependent on data/hvac/minutes_GT.csv; this is generated as mentioned in the instructions for Figure 3.\r\n\r\n* Figure 8: code/havc/disag_optimal_fridge_usage_energy_usage_ratio_outlier_only_disag.py \r\nIt is dependent on data/hvac/minutes_N2....csv. This is generated using code/hvac/nilm_create_features.py. This requires as inputs the folder code/bash_runs_hvac/N2.... which is generated using code/bash_scripts/hvac/disaggregate_sweep_hvac.sh which calls code/hvac/disaggregate_hvac.py with the required parameters. No changes needed if executed on UVa cluster. If run otherwise, slurm needs to be changed and all the individual bash scripts will need to be serially executed.\r\n\r\n* Figure 9: code/hvac/fridge_low_accuracy_nilm_baseline.py. Prerequisites are the same as that for Figure 8.\r\n\r\n* Figure 10: code/fridge/plot_power_level.py. Prerequisites are the same as that for Figure 8.\r\n\r\n* Figure 11: code/hvac/model_accuracy_nilm_gt_confusion_only_nilm.py\r\nIt is dependent on:\r\n\t1. minutes_*.csv: which is generated as mentioned in Figure 8.\r\n\t2. rf_hvac.pkl: code/hvac/model_accuracy.py\r\n\r\n* Figure 12: code/hvac/hvac_feedback_low_accuracy_reason.py\r\n\r\n#### Contact information:\r\n\r\nNipun Batra\r\nnipunb@iiitd.ac.in\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
