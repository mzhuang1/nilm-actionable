### If you can measure, can you save it? Exploring The Value of Energy Disaggregation

This is the github repository corresponding to our Buildsys 2015 paper, whose details are as follows:


#### Code for generating figures

* Figure 1: code/fridge/fridge_demo.py 
The depenendecies for this is to download the Hoboware folder from here and place in ~/Documents

* Figure 2: code/fridge/rice_hall_precision_recall_energy.py
All the required code is already contained in the Github repo

* Figure 3: code/hvac/model_setpoint_accuracy.py. This requires data/hvac/top_k_2013.json which is generated using code/hvac/find_top_k_hvac.py. The data/hvac/minutes_GT.csv is created by calling code/hvac/create_hvac_feature_csvs.py

* Figure 4: code/fridge/fridge_usage_energy_usage_ratio_outlier.py
It is dependent on `usage_defrost_cycles.csv` which is already there in the Github repository. This CSV can be generated by calling
code/fridge/fridge_compressor_durations_optimised_jul_7.py. It must be noted that `d_new.to_csv("../../data/fridge/usage_defrost_cycles.csv", index_label="home")` should be uncommented! The function is generic.

* Figure 5: code/fridge/fridge_defrost_num_cycles_ratio_outlier.py
It is dependent on `usage_defrost_cycles.csv` which is already there in the Github repository. Remaining instructions same as that for Figure 4.

* Figure 6: code/fridge/fridge_malfunction.py
Remaining things were edited in Preview.

* Figure 7: code/hvac/model_accuracy_nilm_gt_confusion_only_gt.py
It is dependent on data/hvac/minutes_GT.csv; this is generated as mentioned in the instructions for Figure 3.

* Figure 8: code/havc/disag_optimal_fridge_usage_energy_usage_ratio_outlier_only_disag.py 
It is dependent on data/hvac/minutes_N2....csv. This is generated using code/hvac/nilm_create_features.py. This requires as inputs the folder code/bash_runs_hvac/N2.... which is generated using code/bash_scripts/hvac/disaggregate_sweep_hvac.sh which calls code/hvac/disaggregate_hvac.py with the required parameters. No changes needed if executed on UVa cluster. If run otherwise, slurm needs to be changed and all the individual bash scripts will need to be serially executed.

* Figure 9: IPython notebook

* Figure 10: code/fridge/plot_power_level.py


* Figure 11: code/hvac/model_accuracy_nilm_gt_confusion_only_nilm.py
It is dependent on:
	1. minutes_*.csv: which is generated by 
	2. rf_hvac.pkl: 

* Figure 12: IPython notebook
